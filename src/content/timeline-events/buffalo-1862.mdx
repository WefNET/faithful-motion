By the time Edward was 17, he was living in Buffalo with his family and working as a compositor for the Buffalo Christian Advocats Office (a Methodist newspaper). Here is his letter of recommendation, now over 150 years old, made into a photograph, then posted on heavy cardboard:

  To whom it may concern, this may certify that Edward Vandeberg (sic) was appointed to me in A.D. 1862 as compositor in the Buffalo Christian Advocat Office and continuted in my employ until I sold out in 1863. Since which he has remained in the same office until quite recently, filling the position of foreman most of his time. His conduct has been exemplary, and his application and attention to the duties in the office very satisfactory; and I take pleasure in stating that I regard him as a young man of good principles, strict integrity, and industrious habits, whose success in life I sincerely hope may by equal to deserts.
