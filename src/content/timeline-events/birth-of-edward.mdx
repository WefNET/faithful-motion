Edward was born in 1845 in Waterford, New York to Moses and Anna Vandenburgh. His hometown, Waterford, is at the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers and is the eastern gateway to the Erie Canal. I can imagine Edward and his
older brothers, Nathaniel and Jesse, watching the boats and barges move into the canal on their trips to and from New York City and Buffalo.

There is ancedotal evidence that Edward's family ran a ferry that crossed the Hudson.
